Dominoes for Sara
=================

Dominoes for Sara - a work in progress.  This is a learning tangent inspired by  the lighttable demo on the kaazing website.  For some reason that demo
inspired me to make a dominoes game to play with my sister, Sara, rather than just moving
pretty pictures around.  And that seemed like a good learning project for learning
web sockets in general, specifically with pub/sub messaging, which I wanted to 
learn about for another project...
